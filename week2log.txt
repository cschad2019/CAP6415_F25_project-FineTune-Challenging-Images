Week 2 Log - CAP6415 F25 Project  
Student: Cale Schad (z23503021)  
Repo: https://github.com/cschad2019/CAP6415_F25_project-FineTune-Challenging-Images  

What I set out to do  
- Get a clean, reproducible baseline on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18.  
- Define configs for baseline and targeted fine-tune.  
- Make the project easy to run via CLI/VS Code.  

Work completed  
1) Environment & setup  
- Created/activated a dedicated venv; verified installs from requirements.txt.  
- Resolved PowerShell execution policy for venv activation.  
- Added seeds to configs/CLI for reproducibility planning.  

2) Code prep  
- Reviewed src/train.py, src/eval.py, src/data.py, src/model.py for CIFAR-10 flow.  
- Drafted configs/baseline.yaml and configs/finetune_target_class.yaml (focus_class placeholder).  
- Added VS Code tasks/launch entries for baseline/fine-tune runs.  

3) Validation (no full training yet)  
- Dry-ran scripts to ensure imports/paths work on the local machine.  
- Confirmed CIFAR-10 download path and results folder creation.  

Notes / Issues  
- No blockers; ready to run the full baseline next.  

Plan for Week 3  
- Run the full baseline training/eval on CPU.  
- Capture confusion matrix and per-class precision; identify the weakest class.  
- Update README/How to run with actual commands and outcomes.
