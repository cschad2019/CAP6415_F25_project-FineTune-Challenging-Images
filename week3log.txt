Week 3 (ending Nov 23, 2025) — Log
Author: Cale Schad (z23503021)

What I planned:
- Add a one-click run path in VS Code for both baseline and fine-tune.
- Provide a single entry script to run baseline/finetune end-to-end.
- Run targeted fine-tuning and document before/after results.
- Update README with results, plots, and step-by-step run instructions.

What I did:
- Added one-click run via VS Code:
  - .vscode/tasks.json → “Baseline: Train+Eval”, “Finetune: Train+Eval”
  - .vscode/launch.json → run without debugging using debugpy
- Created pipeline script:
  - scripts/run_pipeline.py supports: --mode baseline | finetune, --seed 42
- Fine-tuned the model from the baseline checkpoint:
  - Focused prior weak class, oversampling + mild augmentations, froze backbone
  - Results (CPU):
    - Baseline: overall acc ≈ 0.761; worst class = cat (precision ≈ 0.536)
    - Finetuned: overall acc ≈ 0.841; cat ≈ 0.804; new worst = bird (≈ 0.571)
- Produced & saved artifacts:
  - results/baseline_confusion_matrix.png
  - results/finetune_confusion_matrix.png
  - results/samples_baseline/{correct_grid.png, wrong_grid.png}
  - results/samples_finetune/{correct_grid.png, wrong_grid.png}
  - results/best.pt, results/best_finetune.pt
- Updated README:
  - Abstract, results table, images, Quick Start (CPU), one-click run, reproducibility notes

What’s next (Week 4 preview):
- Small ablations (lr, oversample factor, unfreezing last block) to see if bird improves
- Refresh plots under results/ and finalize screenshots
- Start drafting demo outline and timing
