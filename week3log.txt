Week 3 — Planned (not yet executed)

Goals:
- Target current weakest class ("bird") from baseline analysis.
- Run short ablations to choose fine-tune settings that help bird without hurting overall acc.

Planned tasks:
1) Data/Training
   - Oversample bird (oversample_factor ∈ {4,6,8}) and compare.
   - Try mild class-targeted augs for bird (random erase p∈{0.1,0.2}, color jitter low).
   - Label smoothing sweep (ε ∈ {0.0, 0.05, 0.1}).
   - LR schedule quick check (step vs cosine), 5–8 epochs.

2) Code/Configs
   - Add config flags for the above; keep seeds fixed (42).
   - Save runs to `results/ablations_week3/` (cm + samples).

3) Reporting
   - Update README results table with best week-3 numbers (cat vs bird precision).
   - Note tradeoffs (per-class gains vs overall acc).

To verify:
- Confusion mat improves bird precision vs week-2.
- No regression >1–2% on overall accuracy.

(Will fill actual outcomes after experiments complete.)
