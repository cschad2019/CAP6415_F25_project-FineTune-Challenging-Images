Project: CAP6415_F25_project-FineTune-Challenging-Images
Student: Cale Schad (z23503021)
Repo: https://github.com/cschad2019/CAP6415_F25_project-FineTune-Challenging-Images

What I did
- Connected VS Code to GitHub.
- Created public repository and pushed the initial commit.
- Set global Git identity (name/email) using FAU address.
- Organized project structure:
  /src (train.py, eval.py, data.py, model.py, utils.py)
  /configs (baseline.yaml, finetune_target_class.yaml)
  /results (curves.png, confusion_matrix.png, best.pt, /samples)
  /demo (video placeholder)
  README.md, requirements.txt, env.yml, .gitignore
- Added week1–week5 log files at repo root for the development diary.
- Wrote initial README skeleton (abstract + run instructions placeholder).
- Added .gitignore to keep caches/venv/checkpoints out of version control.

Artifacts committed this week
- Folder scaffold + placeholder files
- README.md (draft)
- .gitignore, requirements.txt, env.yml
- week1log.txt … week5log.txt

Notes / Issues
- None blocking. Next step is coding a runnable baseline and verifying environment setup.

Plan for Week 2
- Implement baseline training/evaluation on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18).
- Generate initial confusion matrix and identify lowest-precision class.
- Update README with exact commands and results.
