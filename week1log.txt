[Week 1: Nov 3-9, 2025]  
Project: CAP6415_F25_project-FineTune-Challenging-Images  
Student: Cale Schad (z23503021)  
Repo: https://github.com/cschad2019/CAP6415_F25_project-FineTune-Challenging-Images  

What I did  
- Created the public repo and pushed the initial scaffold.  
- Set Git identity with FAU email; connected VS Code to the repo.  
- Laid out project structure:  
  /src (train.py, eval.py, data.py, model.py, utils.py)  
  /configs (baseline.yaml, finetune_target_class.yaml placeholders)  
  /results (placeholders)  
  README.md, requirements.txt, env.yml, .gitignore  
- Added week1-week5 log files and a draft README skeleton (abstract + planned run instructions).  
- Added .gitignore to exclude venv/caches/checkpoints.  

Artifacts committed this week  
- Repo scaffold and placeholders.  
- README.md (draft), requirements.txt, env.yml, .gitignore.  
- week1log.txt through week5log.txt (templates).  

Notes / Issues  
- None blocking; next step is to make the baseline runnable.  

Plan for Week 2  
- Finish wiring the training/eval scripts for CIFAR-10.  
- Verify environment setup on local machine (venv + deps install).  
- Prepare configs for baseline and targeted fine-tune.
