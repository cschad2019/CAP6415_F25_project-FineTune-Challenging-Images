Week 4 — Planned (Preliminary results milestone)

Goals:
- Lock in a stronger fine-tune pass using best week-3 settings.
- Produce “prelim” artifacts for grading.

Planned tasks:
1) Training
   - Warm start from baseline `results/best.pt`.
   - Freeze backbone; unfreeze last block if needed (light fine-tune).
   - 8–12 epochs, cosine LR, early stop on val acc (patience 3).
   - Keep oversample_factor chosen in week-3.

2) Artifacts
   - Save `results/best_finetune.pt`.
   - Export `results/finetune_confusion_matrix.png` and `results/samples_finetune/*`.
   - Generate side-by-side snippet of per-class precision (baseline vs finetune).

3) Repro & UX
   - Confirm one-click VS Code tasks work on a clean venv.
   - Finish `HOW_TO_RUN.md` (1-pager for TA).

4) README
   - Replace placeholders with the new accuracies.
   - Brief interpretation (why bird improves; any new weakest class).

To verify:
- Bird precision increases vs week-3.
- Overall accuracy ≥ week-3 best.
- All scripts runnable via `scripts/run_pipeline.py` and VS Code tasks.

(Outcomes to be appended after runs finish.)
