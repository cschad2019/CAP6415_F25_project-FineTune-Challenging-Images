Week 4 (ending Nov 30, 2025) - Log  
Author: Cale Schad (z23503021)  

What I planned:  
- Run targeted fine-tune on the weakest class from baseline and evaluate.  
- Refresh artifacts (confusion matrix, sample grids) and README with real numbers.  
- Note any training/runtime observations on CPU.  

What I did (Nov 19 run):  
- Fine-tuned for 8 epochs on CPU using configs/finetune_target_class.yaml.  
  - Val acc by epoch: 0.7510, 0.7084, 0.7009, 0.7783, 0.7654, 0.7610, 0.8335, 0.8390.  
  - Best checkpoint saved to results/best_finetune.pt (val acc 0.8390).  
- Evaluated fine-tuned model:  
  - Overall accuracy: 0.839.  
  - Worst class: bird (precision 0.578).  
  - Per-class precision: airplane 0.904, automobile 0.931, bird 0.578, cat 0.838, deer 0.883, dog 0.790, frog 0.920, horse 0.876, ship 0.933, truck 0.927.  
  - Cat precision improved from 0.536 (baseline) → 0.838.  
- Artifacts refreshed: results/finetune_confusion_matrix.png, results/samples_finetune/{correct_grid.png, wrong_grid.png}, results/best_finetune.pt.  
- Updated README results section with the new metrics and before/after comparison.  

Notes / Issues:  
- Pin_memory warning on CPU is expected/harmless.  
- Deterministic flag remains on; runs are reproducible on this hardware.  

Plan for Week 5 preview:  
- Record the demo video (repo tour, run/eval, results).  
- Final pass on docs and logs.
