Week 5 — Planned (Finalization + Video)

Goals:
- Freeze final code/results and record the demo video.

Planned tasks:
1) Final pass
   - Re-run finetune with chosen config to confirm reproducibility.
   - Save “final” copies in `results/finals/` (cm, samples, curves, checkpoints).
   - Tag release `v1.0` on GitHub.

2) Documentation
   - README: final metrics table + two plots embedded.
   - HOW_TO_RUN.md: verified commands, expected outputs, timings on CPU.

3) Video (10–15 min)
   - Intro (problem + repo structure) ~3–4 min.
   - Run baseline → eval (trim) and finetune → eval (trim) ~6–8 min.
   - Results walkthrough (confusion matrices + samples) ~3–4 min.
   - Shortcomings + future work (e.g., CutMix/MixUp, unfreezing deeper layers, longer schedule).

4) Submission
   - Upload video (link in README).
   - Email repo URL + video to instructor per spec.

To verify:
- Fresh clone on CPU reproduces within a few % of reported metrics.
- Video shows start, trimmed middle, and final outputs clearly.

(Will append the final numbers and links after recording.)
