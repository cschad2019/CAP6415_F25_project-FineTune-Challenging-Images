Week 5 (final, pending video)
Author: Cale Schad (z23503021)

Status: To be completed when recording the demo.

Planned tasks:
- Record 10–20 minute demo: intro/repo tour, run or show eval outputs, results walkthrough, runtime notes, shortcomings/future work.
- Add video link to README and submit per instructions.
- Final sanity check of commands on a fresh clone (optional).

Notes:
- Baseline and fine-tune checkpoints/artifacts are already produced (see results/). Will not modify code unless a blocking issue appears during recording.
